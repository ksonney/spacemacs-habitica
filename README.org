* Description
This layer adds support for ryjm's habitrpg.el Habitica integration.

Features:
 - Adds an item to habitica when marked as a TODO in org
 - Marks a habitica todo as complete when marked DONE in org-mode
 - As a nifty TUI in lisp for habitica if you want to use it

2. Open up your =~/.spacemacs= file in, well, spacemacs.
3. Add =habitrpg= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
4. Scroll down to the =spacemacs/user-config= section and add the following
   lines with your habitica API keys
   (setq habitrpg-api-user "ID-HERE")
   (setq habitrpg-api-token "TOKEN-HERE")
5. Save your =~/.spacemacs= file and restart (SPC-q-r)

* Keybindings
- The hook to =org-after-todo-state-change-hook= is transparent to the user.
