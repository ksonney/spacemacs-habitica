* Description
This layer adds support for ryjm's habitrpg.el Habitica integration.

Features:
 - Adds an item to habitica when marked as a TODO in org
 - Marks a habitica todo as complete when marked DONE in org-mode
 - As a nifty TUI in lisp for habitica if you want to use it

* Install
To use this configuration layer, you will need to do the following :
  
- clone it to =~/.emacs.d/private/habitrpg= like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/ksonney/spacemacs-habitica.git ~/.emacs.d/private/habitica
#+END_SRC
- Open up your =~/.spacemacs= file in, well, spacemacs.
- Add =habitrpg= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
- Scroll down to the =spacemacs/user-config= section and add the following lines with your habitica API keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (setq habitrpg-api-user "ID-HERE")
   (setq habitrpg-api-token "TOKEN-HERE")
#+END_SRC
- Save your =~/.spacemacs= file and restart (SPC-q-r)

* Keybindings
- The hook to =org-after-todo-state-change-hook= is transparent to the user.
- To bring up the habitrpg.el habitica status view, use SPC-a-H
- Using =habitrpg-add= as a standalone function is currently unmapped
